## Generate a test likelihood function. 
ll <- generateTestDensityMultiNormal(sigma = "no correlation")

## Create a BayesianSetup object from the likelihood 
## is the recommended way of using the runMCMC() function.
bayesianSetup <- createBayesianSetup(likelihood = ll, lower = rep(-10, 3), upper = rep(10, 3))

## Finally we can run the sampler and have a look
settings = list(iterations = 1000, adapt = FALSE)
out <- runMCMC(bayesianSetup = bayesianSetup, sampler = "Metropolis", settings = settings)


marginalPlot(out)
marginalPlot(out, plotPrior = F)
marginalPlot(out, histogram = T)
marginalPlot(out, singlePanel = T, scale=T, col = c("red", "blue"))
